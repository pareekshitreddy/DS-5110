1 Summary
Data analytics in the hotel industry is key to marketing strategy, building customer loyalty and
enhancing productivity. It enables hotels to personalize experiences for their guests, introduce
better hotel pricing strategies and expand their customer base.Also, it helps customers in analysing
which is the best season to travel to a particular location,what are the services included in booking,is
the hotel ready to customize their experience based on their special requests and when and where
can they find a room with the lowest rate. The dataset we are using contains booking information
for a city hotel and a resort hotel over the period 2015-2017. The dataset consists of over 100k
records and contains fields such as date of booking, lead time, duration of stay, country, the status
of the booking, etc.
Our project goals are :
1. To analyze the best time of year to book a hotel room and the optimal length of stay to get
the best daily rate.
2. To classify customers based on who is more likely to cancel their booking.
3. To predict the number of future guests for both hotel types.
4. Predicting the likelihood of a disproportionately high number of special requests.
